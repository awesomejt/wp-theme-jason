	* Apache
	* MySQL
	* PHP
* Setup links to themes and media folders for wordpress content

## Requirements

 * Vagrant
 * Virtual Box with Guest Additions installed
 * Internet connection

## Setup

1. Clone this repo into unique folder

		git clone https://github.com/srctips/vagrant-wordpress.git my-wp-project
		
2. Review the files in the __setup__ folder.
	* Remember to sync up any changes between the other files -- for example any database connection updates.
3. Start Vagrant

## Important Files and Folders

### Vagrant Folder

By default, Vagrant setups the __/vagrant__ folder on the guest OS within the virtual machine.
The __/vagrant__ folder maps to the source directory containing the _Vagrantfile_ on the host machine.

### Media

The __/vagrant/media__ maps to the _uploads_ folder in Wordpress. Any images here should
appear on both the host machine.

### Themes

The __/vagrant/themes__ maps to the _themes_ folder in Wordpress. Any new themes installed
via Wordpress will be reflected here and any new folders created here from scratch will
appear in Wordpress.

### Git Ignore

The __/vagrant/.gitignore__ file manages what files are excluded from version control within Git.
Currently, media and default Wordpress themes.
